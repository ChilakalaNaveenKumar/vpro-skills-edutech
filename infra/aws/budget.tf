# Cost safety net: emails var.alert_email if forecast spend for the month
# crosses var.monthly_budget_usd (default $100) - cheap insurance against
# a misconfiguration or traffic spike silently running up a bill
# unnoticed. This is a forecast alert (fires before the month even ends,
# based on trending spend), not just an after-the-fact notice.
